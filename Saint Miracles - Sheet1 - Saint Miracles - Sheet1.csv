Huh? How the f would a wikipedia biography article writer know about Ronconi's 12th century jealous sister-in-law and why is this even mentioned? Who gives a f about some random jealous relative of a saint? So weird. ""Pope Pius VI beatified Ronconi on 17 April 1776 while waiving the requirement for two miracles attributed to his intercession. The cause reopened a long while later when the postulation sent the Positio dossier to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 2010 where the latter had historians discuss and approve the cause on 27 April 2010.

Amatus of Nusco,,,,"""Numerous miracles were reported at the site of his tomb and his cult developed to the point where he became recognised as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, celebrated in the Roman Martyrology on 30 September.""

Ampelius (bishop of Milan),"""Ampelius is remembered as man able to do miracles, but we have no detail about his acts""",,,"The demon that wrote his wiki article makes it a point to emphasize the disputes about Ampelius's 'feast day', and the location of his 'relics'.

Amphibalus,"""According to the tale, Saint Alban appeared in a vision to a monk named Robert, indicating that he wished to make the location of the remains of Amphibalus known. Robert followed the spirit of Alban and was led by the saint to the remains of Amphibalus and his companions.

André-Hubert Fournet,"""He is said to have - in what was seen as a miracle - multiplied food for the members of the new congregation and their charges a number of times.""

No mention of what the actual miracles were.",,,,
