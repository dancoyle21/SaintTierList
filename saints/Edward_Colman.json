He has been described as a man of  considerable charm and ability,  but lacking in common sense or political realism. Sir Robert Southwell, who knew him well,  called him \"a man who must run himself into the briars\". He was married: his wife has been described as a woman of great charm, but little else seems to be known of her. In appearance he  was strikingly pale and emaciated, due it was said to his  practice of  regular <a href=\"/wiki/Fasting\" title=\"Fasting\">fasting</a>; his white face being all  the more noticeable because he always wore a black <a href=\"/wiki/Periwig\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Periwig\">periwig</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Career\">Career</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Colman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Career\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In June 1661 he became a <a href=\"/wiki/Gentleman_pensioner\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gentleman pensioner\">gentleman pensioner</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Charles_II_of_England\" title=\"Charles II of England\">Charles II</a>. He was a charismatic advocate of the Catholic cause and is credited with several high-profile conversions, including possibly the future <a href=\"/wiki/James_II_of_England\" title=\"James II of England\">James II</a>. In 1673 James appointed him secretary to his wife, <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_of_Modena\" title=\"Mary of Modena\">Mary of Modena</a>, despite warnings from several quarters, including Charles II himself, that he was not a man to be trusted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ODNB_1-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ODNB-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> \n</p><p>The passing of the <a href=\"/wiki/Test_Act\" title=\"Test Act\">Test Act</a> in the same year, barring Catholics from public office,  has been described as a shattering blow to his hopes of an important political career, and  condemned  him to a life of \"backstairs intrigue\", unless he could get the Act repealed. This explains his  repeated efforts to obtain a dissolution of the <a href=\"/wiki/Cavalier_Parliament\" title=\"Cavalier Parliament\">Cavalier Parliament</a>, although his belief that a new Parliament would be disposed to repeal the Test Act was  shared by no one else. His intrigues  were so ill-judged that they  led to the Cavalier Parliament in its final session passing a second  and more stringent Test Act, while  the next Parliament, elected after Colman's death was,  quite contrary to his predictions,  even more hostile to Catholicism than its predecessor.\n</p><p>He visited <a href=\"/wiki/Brussels\" title=\"Brussels\">Brussels</a> in the hope of gaining support  from the <a href=\"/wiki/Papal_nuncio\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Papal nuncio\">Papal nuncio</a>  there for  a scheme for increased tolerance for English Catholics, but nothing came of it. He also  visited Paris without an official pass, which was later used in evidence against him at his trial in 1678. Subsequently, he was in contact with highly placed Catholics in France. Through  an English  Catholic army  officer stationed in <a href=\"/wiki/Paris\" title=\"Paris\">Paris</a>,  Sir William Throckmorton,  he passed on political information to the Jesuit Jean Ferrier who was <a href=\"/wiki/Confessor\" title=\"Confessor\">confessor</a> to <a href=\"/wiki/Louis_XIV\" title=\"Louis XIV\">Louis XIV</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">:<span>40</span></sup> In 1675 he offered his services in favour of Catholicism to <a href=\"/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_de_la_Chaise\" title=\"Fran\u00e7ois de la Chaise\">Fran\u00e7ois de la Chaise</a>, successor to Ferrier as royal confessor; in 1676 he was in communication with Father Saint-Germain, former <a href=\"/wiki/Confessor\" title=\"Confessor\">confessor</a>  to  Charles II's sister-in-law <a href=\"/wiki/Mary_of_Modena\" title=\"Mary of Modena\">Mary of Modena</a>,  offering his assistance to prevent a rupture between England and France. These attempts failed to procure money, due mainly to the scepticism of <a href=\"/wiki/Simon_Arnauld,_Marquis_de_Pomponne\" title=\"Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne\">Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne</a>, Louis' Foreign Minister, who put no faith in Colman, Throckmorton or indeed King Charles II, whom he did not  even think worth  the trouble of bribing. Louis evidently shared this view:   as Throckmorton admitted  \"he (Louis)  hath so mean an opinion of King Charles and all his partners, he scarce thinks anything we do worth money\". Colman succeeded later in obtaining \u00a33500 from three successive French ambassadors, whom he supplied with information on the proceedings of Parliament.<sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Colman acted independently of Charles II  in trying to obtain French financial assistance to reduce the King's dependence on the <a href=\"/wiki/Anti-Catholic\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Anti-Catholic\">anti-Catholic</a> Parliament. When money was eventually secured by Charles,  it was not through any of Colman's efforts. Throckmorton had been killed in a <a href=\"/wiki/Duel\" title=\"Duel\">duel</a>  in  the spring of 1675: this,  following  Ferrier's death  the previous winter,  deprived Colman of his most  useful contacts at the French Court.  He was still in touch with Father  Saint-Germain, but this  connection did him nothing but harm, as Saint-Germain, who had been forced to flee from England after allegedly threatening the life of a former  Catholic priest called de Luzancy,  was regarded  as even  more unstable and fanatical than Colman himself.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ODNB_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ODNB-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer\" title=\"Lord High Treasurer\">Lord High Treasurer</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Osborne,_Earl_of_Danby\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby\">Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby</a> viewed Colman as a dangerous influence on James, a view shared by the King.  Danby had him dismissed in 1676 after Colman was caught leaking naval intelligence in a newsletter; according both to the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography\" title=\"Dictionary of National Biography\">Dictionary of National Biography</a></i> and recent research, the dismissal was at the prompting of the <a href=\"/wiki/Bishop_of_London\" title=\"Bishop of London\">Bishop of London</a>,  <a href=\"/wiki/Henry_Compton_(bishop)\" title=\"Henry Compton (bishop)\">Henry Compton</a>, although <a href=\"/wiki/Antonia_Fraser\" title=\"Antonia Fraser\">Antonia Fraser</a>  notes that the King himself had on several  occasions urged his brother to dismiss him. <sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Edward continued with unofficial duties for James and he may have disbursed bribes to MPs on behalf of the French ambassador.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ODNB_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ODNB-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In the summer of 1678 he clashed  with the  vehemently anti-Catholic Welsh landowner <a href=\"/wiki/John_Arnold_of_Monmouthshire\" title=\"John Arnold of Monmouthshire\">John Arnold of Monmouthshire</a>, who challenged him to a <a href=\"/wiki/Duel\" title=\"Duel\">duel</a>, alleging that Colman was responsible for Arnold being dismissed from his office as <a href=\"/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace\" title=\"Justice of the peace\">justice of the peace</a> (the dismissal was in fact the result of a local feud in Monmouthshire). The duel never took place. Arnold was no doubt delighted by Colman's ruin and death, but does not seem to have played any part in his downfall.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Popish_Plot\">The Popish Plot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Colman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The Popish Plot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Colman was targeted by Oates when the latter presented his fantasy, the  Popish Plot,  before the King and the <a href=\"/wiki/Privy_Council\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Privy Council\">Privy Council</a> on 28 September 1678. Oates did not know Colman personally: this caused him some awkward moments at Colman's trial, where he had  great difficulty in explaining his failure to recognise  him   at the subsequent  Council meeting of 30 September. Oates however  had evidently learnt enough about Colman  to realise  that he was vulnerable to attack, due to his intrigues with the French Court, futile though they were. According  to Oates, Colman would become secretary of state on the death of Charles.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ODNB_1-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ODNB-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> It later emerged that the magistrate, Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Edmund_Berry_Godfrey\" title=\"Edmund Berry Godfrey\">Edmund Berry Godfrey</a>, had contacted Colman, who was a friend of his,  shortly after the meeting and the following day Colman's house was searched; letters covering his dealings with France were uncovered.<sup id=\"cite_ref-ODNB_1-5\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ODNB-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arrest\">Arrest</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Colman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Arrest\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The warrant for his apprehension was sent out on Sunday night, 29 September. At the suggestion of Danby, Colman's papers were to be searched for thoroughly. <a href=\"/wiki/William_Bedloe\" title=\"William Bedloe\">William Bedloe</a> carried the warrant to apprehend Colman and search for his papers.  Oates,  in  what seems to have been an inspired piece of guesswork, had already  suggested that  if Colman's letters  were opened,   in particular his letters to Father La Chaise,  they would contain treasonable matter, \"which might cost him his neck\". Whether  this was his own notion,  or whether it was suggested  to him by someone else, is unclear. Colman's  papers were found, some of recent date in paper bags; incriminating letters of earlier years were in a deal box, slightly nailed down.  The Government expressed its surprise that after several days warning Colman should have made so little effort to hide them properly: a new pavement had recently been laid in the house, though it is not clear if it was intended as a hiding place. Inexplicably, Colman continued to deny having written the letters  for several weeks after they were discovered. It  is  possible, as Kenyon suggests, that after  a lapse of four or five  years he had actually   forgotten writing them, or  perhaps he did not yet realise the danger they put him  in. <sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The letters were carried off, but Colman's wife declared him to be absent, and to the Government's later embarrassment she persuaded the searchers to let her keep several bundles of letters  which she claimed were personal.  His sister  removed a trunk full of documents from his house a week later, rousing further suspicions about what incriminating evidence  her brother was concealing. \n</p><p>On Monday morning he came forward voluntarily, and offered himself to the Secretary of State, <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_Joseph_Williamson\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir Joseph Williamson\">Sir Joseph Williamson</a>. In the afternoon he was heard before <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_Robert_Southwell\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir Robert Southwell\">Sir Robert Southwell</a>, and others of the  <a href=\"/wiki/Privy_Council_of_England\" title=\"Privy Council of England\">Privy Council</a>, in  the presence of Oates, who was unable to recognise him. He  made so \"voluble and fair a defence\", urging his voluntary appearance as proof of his \"innocence of these vile things\",  that the Council, exhausted by the long day's proceedings, decided not to order his arrest.  He was only committed to the  care of a messenger, and his papers were not searched carefully till a week later. <sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>The informers  seemed about to lose credit when the death of Sir <a href=\"/wiki/Edmund_Berry_Godfrey\" title=\"Edmund Berry Godfrey\">Edmund Berry Godfrey</a>  revived the flagging investigation. On 16 October Colman was removed from the messenger's care and committed to <a href=\"/wiki/Newgate_Prison\" title=\"Newgate Prison\">Newgate Prison</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DNB_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DNB-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Even a careful scrutiny of his letters revealed nothing directly pertaining to Oates' allegations, but the Government was horrified at the manner in which a minor <a href=\"/wiki/Civil_servant\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Civil servant\">civil servant</a>  had undertaken on behalf of  a foreign power to alter the Government of England, while they were naturally irritated by the unflattering portraits Colman had given Louis XIV of themselves.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> The legal advice to the Crown was that some of the letters were clearly treasonable. Kenyon argues that the King decided to make an example of Colman, in order to reassure the public that the Crown would allow the law to take its course even against Court officials, and  that he was happy to sacrifice a man whom he had always distrusted.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> By 10 November Colman, having been shown the allegedly treasonable  letters, at last admitted to having written them. The strange optimism (Kenyon attributes   it  to a natural levity of mind) which he had shown up to then   finally deserted him: he predicted correctly to the <a href=\"/wiki/House_of_Lords\" title=\"House of Lords\">House of Lords</a>  that \"I have confessed to that which will destroy me\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> (although many believed that he continued to hope in vain for a <a href=\"/wiki/Pardon\" title=\"Pardon\">pardon</a>  right up to the very end).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trial\">Trial</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Colman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Trial\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Parliament had  reassembled on 21 October, in an atmosphere of unprecedented hysteria about the  Plot. Ominously for Colman, the simple cry of \"Colman's letters!\" was enough to cause uproar in the <a href=\"/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England\" title=\"House of Commons of England\">House of Commons</a>.  The Government  decided that  to appease the public's  desire for blood, it was vital that   a few of the suspected plotters  be sacrificed as quickly as possible.  The first victim of the plot was William Staley, a young Catholic <a href=\"/wiki/Banker\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Banker\">banker</a> who had allegedly vowed  to kill the King (in fact the threat  seems to have been simply  a foolish remark  spoken  in drink).  Staley was executed on 26 November 1678, but clearly the death of an  unknown  Catholic layman would not be enough to appease public anger: indeed at Staley's trial the prosecution had some difficulty in explaining why he, as opposed to the  leading Jesuit fathers, was on trial at all.  On 10 November Colman was offered a pardon, if he made a full confession; he was warned that  if found guilty he would suffer in  its full   horror the  gruesome death prescribed for convicted traitors. Colman refused to confess, and preparations were made to try him as quickly as possible.\n</p><p>On Saturday, 23 November 1678, Colman was arraigned for <a href=\"/wiki/High_treason\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"High treason\">high treason</a>, and the trial took place on Wednesday, the 27th, at the <a href=\"/wiki/King%27s_Bench\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"King&#39;s Bench\">King's Bench</a> bar, before the Lord Chief Justice <a href=\"/wiki/William_Scroggs\" title=\"William Scroggs\">William Scroggs</a> and three junior judges. Scroggs was  a firm believer in the Popish Plot, and although he assured Colman that he would receive a fair trial- \"we seek no man's blood,  but only our own safety\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>-  there is no doubt that he was determined to secure a conviction by any means necessary. \n</p><p>Colman declared that he had not continued the correspondence beyond 1674. Oates swore that he had carried a treasonable letter from Colman to the rector of St. Omer, containing a sealed answer to Father La Chaise, with thanks for the ten thousand pounds given for the propagation of the Catholic religion, and chiefly to cut off the King of England. Then followed details of the narrative according to Oates of 'consults' with the Jesuits in May 1678. Arrangements had been made to assassinate the King. 'This resolve of the Jesuits was communicated to Mr. Colman in my hearing at Wild House (i.e. the Spanish <a href=\"/wiki/Embassy\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Embassy\">Embassy</a> in London)' said Oates. Then Oates told of a consultation in August at the Savoy, with Colman present, arranging to poison the <a href=\"/wiki/Duke_of_Ormonde\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Duke of Ormonde\">Duke of Ormonde</a>  and to rise in rebellion. Four Irish ruffians had been sent to <a href=\"/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire\" title=\"Windsor, Berkshire\">Windsor</a>, and \u00a380 for their payment was ordered to be carried by a messenger, to whom Colman gave a guinea. Ten thousand pounds were to be offered to <a href=\"/wiki/Sir_George_Wakeman\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Sir George Wakeman\">Sir George Wakeman</a>, physician to  Queen <a href=\"/wiki/Catherine_of_Braganza\" title=\"Catherine of Braganza\">Catherine of Braganza</a>, to poison the king; instructions had been seen and read by Colman, copied out by him and sent to other conspirators. Colman had been appointed a principal secretary of state by commission from Father D'Oliva (<a href=\"/wiki/Giovanni_Paolo_Oliva\" title=\"Giovanni Paolo Oliva\">Giovanni Paolo Oliva</a>), Superior General of the <a href=\"/wiki/Society_of_Jesus\" title=\"Society of Jesus\">Society of Jesus</a>, (unfortunately for Colman the Government knew that  he had corresponded with Oliva as well as with the  French Court). In cross-examination Oates shuffled and excused himself. In particular he could not explain  to the Court's satisfaction why he had not recognised Colman at the crucial Council meeting of 30  September: the judges  were not impressed with his pleas that it had been late and he was tired. Bedloe was examined concerning the  packets of letters from Colman to Father La Chaise in 1675, which Colman admitted to sending, and the  money  which Colman had received from the French Government to bribe members of Parliament; again, Colman admitted receiving the money, but insisted that he had simply pocketed it. Bedloe, there as at later trials, made a very poor impression. Scroggs, who could never resist the urge to bully a witness,  even one appearing for the Crown, gave both Oates and Bedloe a most unpleasant time in the witness box, but, mindful of the need to secure a conviction, did not go so far as to accuse them of <a href=\"/wiki/Perjury\" title=\"Perjury\">perjury</a>. In his summing up he referred briefly to their evidence (\"you have heard it\") but made no comment, one way or the other,  on their veracity\n</p><p>To spare the Duke of York  any embarrassment, the prosecution did not tell the jury that Colman had ever been in his employment, instead  referring vaguely to Colman  holding an unspecified  public office (although they can scarcely have believed  that the jury were unaware of his  true position). Colman in his defence could have pleaded that he had acted throughout the exchange of correspondence  on the Duke's  express orders. He was clearly tempted to do so, but at the  last moment  he seems to have suffered from a fatal hesitation (perhaps he still hoped for a pardon),  and took refuge in  evasion and ambiguous remarks such as \"I might possibly make use of the Duke's name; it is possible, they say I did it\". Scroggs, not unreasonably, said&#160;: \"you have such a swimming way of melting words  that it is a troublesome thing for a man to collect matter out of them\".\n</p><p>The finding of the letters having been certified, and the handwriting identified as Colman's, they were put in evidence, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Attorney_General_for_England_and_Wales\" title=\"Attorney General for England and Wales\">Attorney-General</a> <a href=\"/wiki/William_Jones_(law-officer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"William Jones (law-officer)\">William Jones</a> laid great stress on them; they did prove the strong desire of Colman for the dissolution of parliament. He plainly had advocated foreign bribery of the king to insure such a dissolution, and used some strong phrases as to the Catholic hopes of suppressing heresy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DNB_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DNB-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Kenyon argues that a case may be made for his guilt,  noting similarities between Colman's case and that of <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Wentworth,_1st_Earl_of_Strafford\" title=\"Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford\">Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford</a>, executed for treason  by act of <a href=\"/wiki/Attainder\" title=\"Attainder\">attainder</a>  in 1640.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Verdict_and_execution\">Verdict and execution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Colman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Verdict and execution\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There was no proof of  any conspiracy by Colman in a  plot for the  assassination of, or a rebellion against Charles II  except the perjured testimony of Oates and Bedloe. Nonetheless the jury, following the unmistakable instructions from Scroggs in his summing up, found Colman guilty. Scroggs replied to his solemn declarations of innocence:  'Mr. Colman, your own papers are enough to condemn you.' Next morning a sentence of death and confiscation of property was pronounced, and on Tuesday, 3 December, he was executed, avowing his faith and declaring his innocence. Some onlookers thought that  he was hoping for a reprieve, even at the very end, but it did not come.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DNB_9-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DNB-9\">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ring\">Ring</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Colman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Ring\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A gold signet ring, believed to be Colman's, was found on the banks of <a href=\"/wiki/Loch_Lomond\" title=\"Loch Lomond\">Loch Lomond</a> in 2017 by a detectorist.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Times_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Times-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Edward_Colman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist columns references-column-width\" style=\"-moz-column-width: 30em; -webkit-column-width: 30em; column-width: 30em; list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-ODNB-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-ODNB_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-ODNB_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-ODNB_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-ODNB_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-ODNB_1-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-ODNB_1-5\"><sup><i><b>f</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Andrew Barclay, 'Colman , Edward (1636\u20131678)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3052\">http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3052</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">^</a></b></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite id=\"CITEREFACADCLMN651E\" class=\"citation encyclopaedia cs1\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search-2018.pl?sur=&amp;suro=w&amp;fir=&amp;firo=c&amp;cit=&amp;cito=c&amp;c=all&amp;z=all&amp;tex=CLMN651E&amp;sye=&amp;eye=&amp;col=all&amp;maxcount=50\">\"Colman, Edward (CLMN651E)\"</a>. <i>A Cambridge Alumni Database</i>.

  "formatedtext": "Edward Colman -  Edward Colman  For other uses, see Edward Colman (disambiguation) . \"Coleman drawn to his execution\"; one of a set of playing cards depicting the Popish Plot by Francis Barlow , c. 1679 Edward Colman or Coleman (17 May 1636 \u2013 3 December 1678) was an English Catholic courtier under Charles II of England . He was hanged, drawn and quartered on a treason charge, having been implicated by Titus Oates in his false accusations concerning a Popish Plot . [1] He is a Catholic martyr , beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1929. [2] Contents 1 Life 2 Career 3 The Popish Plot 3.1 Arrest 3.2 Trial 3.3 Verdict and execution 4 Ring 5 References 6 Further reading Life [ edit ] He was born at Brent Eleigh , Suffolk, son of the local vicar Thomas Colman and his wife Margaret Wilson; he  was  a cousin of  the Salisbury MP, Richard Colman . He attended Trinity College, Cambridge , receiving an MA in 1659. [3] Colman, who had been reared  as a strict Puritan ,  converted to Roman Catholicism in the early 1660s. He has been described as a man of  considerable charm and ability,  but lacking in common sense or political realism. Sir Robert Southwell, who knew him well,  called him \"a man who must run himself into the briars\". He was married: his wife has been described as a woman of great charm, but little else seems to be known of her. In appearance he  was strikingly pale and emaciated, due it was said to his  practice of  regular fasting ; his white face being all  the more noticeable because he always wore a black periwig . Career [ edit ] In June 1661 he became a gentleman pensioner to Charles II . He was a charismatic advocate of the Catholic cause and is credited with several high-profile conversions, including possibly the future James II . In 1673 James appointed him secretary to his wife, Mary of Modena , despite warnings from several quarters, including Charles II himself, that he was not a man to be trusted. [1] The passing of the Test Act in the same year, barring Catholics from public office,  has been described as a shattering blow to his hopes of an important political career, and  condemned  him to a life of \"backstairs intrigue\", unless he could get the Act repealed. This explains his  repeated efforts to obtain a dissolution of the Cavalier Parliament , although his belief that a new Parliament would be disposed to repeal the Test Act was  shared by no one else. His intrigues  were so ill-judged that they  led to the Cavalier Parliament in its final session passing a second  and more stringent Test Act, while  the next Parliament, elected after Colman's death was,  quite contrary to his predictions,  even more hostile to Catholicism than its predecessor. He visited Brussels in the hope of gaining support  from the Papal nuncio there for  a scheme for increased tolerance for English Catholics, but nothing came of it. He also  visited Paris without an official pass, which was later used in evidence against him at his trial in 1678. Subsequently, he was in contact with highly placed Catholics in France. Through  an English  Catholic army  officer stationed in Paris ,  Sir William Throckmorton,  he passed on political information to the Jesuit Jean Ferrier who was confessor to Louis XIV . [4] : 40 In 1675 he offered his services in favour of Catholicism to Fran\u00e7ois de la Chaise , successor to Ferrier as royal confessor; in 1676 he was in communication with Father Saint-Germain, former confessor to  Charles II's sister-in-law Mary of Modena ,  offering his assistance to prevent a rupture between England and France. These attempts failed to procure money, due mainly to the scepticism of Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne , Louis' Foreign Minister, who put no faith in Colman, Throckmorton or indeed King Charles II, whom he did not  even think worth  the trouble of bribing. Louis evidently shared this view:   as Throckmorton admitted  \"he (Louis)  hath so mean an opinion of King Charles and all his partners, he scarce thinks anything we do worth money\". Colman succeeded later in obtaining \u00a33500 from three successive French ambassadors, whom he supplied with information on the proceedings of Parliament. [5] Colman acted independently of Charles II  in trying to obtain French financial assistance to reduce the King's dependence on the anti-Catholic Parliament. When money was eventually secured by Charles,  it was not through any of Colman's efforts. Throckmorton had been killed in a duel in  the spring of 1675: this,  following  Ferrier's death  the previous winter,  deprived Colman of his most  useful contacts at the French Court.  He was still in touch with Father  Saint-Germain, but this  connection did him nothing but harm, as Saint-Germain, who had been forced to flee from England after allegedly threatening the life of a former  Catholic priest called de Luzancy,  was regarded  as even  more unstable and fanatical than Colman himself. [1] Lord High Treasurer Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby viewed Colman as a dangerous influence on James, a view shared by the King.  Danby had him dismissed in 1676 after Colman was caught leaking naval intelligence in a newsletter; according both to the Dictionary of National Biography and recent research, the dismissal was at the prompting of the Bishop of London , Henry Compton , although Antonia Fraser notes that the King himself had on several  occasions urged his brother to dismiss him. [6] Edward continued with unofficial duties for James and he may have disbursed bribes to MPs on behalf of the French ambassador. [1] In the summer of 1678 he clashed  with the  vehemently anti-Catholic Welsh landowner John Arnold of Monmouthshire , who challenged him to a duel , alleging that Colman was responsible for Arnold being dismissed from his office as justice of the peace (the dismissal was in fact the result of a local feud in Monmouthshire). The duel never took place. Arnold was no doubt delighted by Colman's ruin and death, but does not seem to have played any part in his downfall. The Popish Plot [ edit ] Colman was targeted by Oates when the latter presented his fantasy, the  Popish Plot,  before the King and the Privy Council on 28 September 1678. Oates did not know Colman personally: this caused him some awkward moments at Colman's trial, where he had  great difficulty in explaining his failure to recognise  him   at the subsequent  Council meeting of 30 September. Oates however  had evidently learnt enough about Colman  to realise  that he was vulnerable to attack, due to his intrigues with the French Court, futile though they were. According  to Oates, Colman would become secretary of state on the death of Charles. [1] It later emerged that the magistrate, Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey , had contacted Colman, who was a friend of his,  shortly after the meeting and the following day Colman's house was searched; letters covering his dealings with France were uncovered. [1] Arrest [ edit ] The warrant for his apprehension was sent out on Sunday night, 29 September. At the suggestion of Danby, Colman's papers were to be searched for thoroughly. William Bedloe carried the warrant to apprehend Colman and search for his papers.  Oates,  in  what seems to have been an inspired piece of guesswork, had already  suggested that  if Colman's letters  were opened,   in particular his letters to Father La Chaise,  they would contain treasonable matter, \"which might cost him his neck\". Whether  this was his own notion,  or whether it was suggested  to him by someone else, is unclear. Colman's  papers were found, some of recent date in paper bags; incriminating letters of earlier years were in a deal box, slightly nailed down.  The Government expressed its surprise that after several days warning Colman should have made so little effort to hide them properly: a new pavement had recently been laid in the house, though it is not clear if it was intended as a hiding place. Inexplicably, Colman continued to deny having written the letters  for several weeks after they were discovered. It  is  possible, as Kenyon suggests, that after  a lapse of four or five  years he had actually   forgotten writing them, or  perhaps he did not yet realise the danger they put him  in. [7] The letters were carried off, but Colman's wife declared him to be absent, and to the Government's later embarrassment she persuaded the searchers to let her keep several bundles of letters  which she claimed were personal.  His sister  removed a trunk full of documents from his house a week later, rousing further suspicions about what incriminating evidence  her brother was concealing. On Monday morning he came forward voluntarily, and offered himself to the Secretary of State, Sir Joseph Williamson . In the afternoon he was heard before Sir Robert Southwell , and others of the Privy Council , in  the presence of Oates, who was unable to recognise him. He  made so \"voluble and fair a defence\", urging his voluntary appearance as proof of his \"innocence of these vile things\",  that the Council, exhausted by the long day's proceedings, decided not to order his arrest.  He was only committed to the  care of a messenger, and his papers were not searched carefully till a week later. [8] The informers  seemed about to lose credit when the death of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey revived the flagging investigation. On 16 October Colman was removed from the messenger's care and committed to Newgate Prison . [9] Even a careful scrutiny of his letters revealed nothing directly pertaining to Oates' allegations, but the Government was horrified at the manner in which a minor civil servant had undertaken on behalf of  a foreign power to alter the Government of England, while they were naturally irritated by the unflattering portraits Colman had given Louis XIV of themselves. [10] The legal advice to the Crown was that some of the letters were clearly treasonable. Kenyon argues that the King decided to make an example of Colman, in order to reassure the public that the Crown would allow the law to take its course even against Court officials, and  that he was happy to sacrifice a man whom he had always distrusted. [11] By 10 November Colman, having been shown the allegedly treasonable  letters, at last admitted to having written them. The strange optimism (Kenyon attributes   it  to a natural levity of mind) which he had shown up to then   finally deserted him: he predicted correctly to the House of Lords that \"I have confessed to that which will destroy me\" [12] (although many believed that he continued to hope in vain for a pardon right up to the very end). Trial [ edit ] Parliament had  reassembled on 21 October, in an atmosphere of unprecedented hysteria about the  Plot. Ominously for Colman, the simple cry of \"Colman's letters!\" was enough to cause uproar in the House of Commons .  The Government  decided that  to appease the public's  desire for blood, it was vital that   a few of the suspected plotters  be sacrificed as quickly as possible.  The first victim of the plot was William Staley, a young Catholic banker who had allegedly vowed  to kill the King (in fact the threat  seems to have been simply  a foolish remark  spoken  in drink).  Staley was executed on 26 November 1678, but clearly the death of an  unknown  Catholic layman would not be enough to appease public anger: indeed at Staley's trial the prosecution had some difficulty in explaining why he, as opposed to the  leading Jesuit fathers, was on trial at all.  On 10 November Colman was offered a pardon, if he made a full confession; he was warned that  if found guilty he would suffer in  its full   horror the  gruesome death prescribed for convicted traitors. Colman refused to confess, and preparations were made to try him as quickly as possible. On Saturday, 23 November 1678, Colman was arraigned for high treason , and the trial took place on Wednesday, the 27th, at the King's Bench bar, before the Lord Chief Justice William Scroggs and three junior judges. Scroggs was  a firm believer in the Popish Plot, and although he assured Colman that he would receive a fair trial- \"we seek no man's blood,  but only our own safety\" [13] -  there is no doubt that he was determined to secure a conviction by any means necessary. Colman declared that he had not continued the correspondence beyond 1674. Oates swore that he had carried a treasonable letter from Colman to the rector of St. Omer, containing a sealed answer to Father La Chaise, with thanks for the ten thousand pounds given for the propagation of the Catholic religion, and chiefly to cut off the King of England. Then followed details of the narrative according to Oates of 'consults' with the Jesuits in May 1678. Arrangements had been made to assassinate the King. 'This resolve of the Jesuits was communicated to Mr. Colman in my hearing at Wild House (i.e. the Spanish Embassy in London)' said Oates. Then Oates told of a consultation in August at the Savoy, with Colman present, arranging to poison the Duke of Ormonde and to rise in rebellion. Four Irish ruffians had been sent to Windsor , and \u00a380 for their payment was ordered to be carried by a messenger, to whom Colman gave a guinea. Ten thousand pounds were to be offered to Sir George Wakeman , physician to  Queen Catherine of Braganza , to poison the king; instructions had been seen and read by Colman, copied out by him and sent to other conspirators. Colman had been appointed a principal secretary of state by commission from Father D'Oliva ( Giovanni Paolo Oliva ), Superior General of the Society of Jesus , (unfortunately for Colman the Government knew that  he had corresponded with Oliva as well as with the  French Court). In cross-examination Oates shuffled and excused himself. In particular he could not explain  to the Court's satisfaction why he had not recognised Colman at the crucial Council meeting of 30  September: the judges  were not impressed with his pleas that it had been late and he was tired. Bedloe was examined concerning the  packets of letters from Colman to Father La Chaise in 1675, which Colman admitted to sending, and the  money  which Colman had received from the French Government to bribe members of Parliament; again, Colman admitted receiving the money, but insisted that he had simply pocketed it. Bedloe, there as at later trials, made a very poor impression. Scroggs, who could never resist the urge to bully a witness,  even one appearing for the Crown, gave both Oates and Bedloe a most unpleasant time in the witness box, but, mindful of the need to secure a conviction, did not go so far as to accuse them of perjury . In his summing up he referred briefly to their evidence (\"you have heard it\") but made no comment, one way or the other,  on their veracity To spare the Duke of York  any embarrassment, the prosecution did not tell the jury that Colman had ever been in his employment, instead  referring vaguely to Colman  holding an unspecified  public office (although they can scarcely have believed  that the jury were unaware of his  true position). Colman in his defence could have pleaded that he had acted throughout the exchange of correspondence  on the Duke's  express orders. He was clearly tempted to do so, but at the  last moment  he seems to have suffered from a fatal hesitation (perhaps he still hoped for a pardon),  and took refuge in  evasion and ambiguous remarks such as \"I might possibly make use of the Duke's name; it is possible, they say I did it\". Scroggs, not unreasonably, said\u00a0: \"you have such a swimming way of melting words  that it is a troublesome thing for a man to collect matter out of them\". The finding of the letters having been certified, and the handwriting identified as Colman's, they were put in evidence, and the Attorney-General William Jones laid great stress on them; they did prove the strong desire of Colman for the dissolution of parliament. He plainly had advocated foreign bribery of the king to insure such a dissolution, and used some strong phrases as to the Catholic hopes of suppressing heresy. [9] Kenyon argues that a case may be made for his guilt,  noting similarities between Colman's case and that of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford , executed for treason  by act of attainder in 1640. [14] Verdict and execution [ edit ] There was no proof of  any conspiracy by Colman in a  plot for the  assassination of, or a rebellion against Charles II  except the perjured testimony of Oates and Bedloe. Nonetheless the jury, following the unmistakable instructions from Scroggs in his summing up, found Colman guilty. Scroggs replied to his solemn declarations of innocence:  'Mr. Colman, your own papers are enough to condemn you.' Next morning a sentence of death and confiscation of property was pronounced, and on Tuesday, 3 December, he was executed, avowing his faith and declaring his innocence. Some onlookers thought that  he was hoping for a reprieve, even at the very end, but it did not come. [9] Ring [ edit ] A gold signet ring, believed to be Colman's, was found on the banks of Loch Lomond in 2017 by a detectorist.
