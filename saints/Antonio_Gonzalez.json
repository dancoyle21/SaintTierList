Buenaventura Paredes was the 78th successor of St. Dominic as Master of the Order of Preachers. Born to a pious family in Casta\u00f1edo de Valdes, Luarca, Spain on April 19, 1866, Buenaventura eventually decided to enter the Order of Preachers and received the Dominican habit on August 30, 1833. True to the Dominican tradition of scholarship, he studied Theology, Civil Law, and Philosophy and Letters prior to his ordination to the priesthood on July 25, 1891. After his ordination, he pursued further studies with which he earned his doctorate in Philosophy and Letters and in Jurisprudence. He then traveled to the Philippines as a missionary assigned to the Dominican Province of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary. While in Manila, he obtained the degree of lector in theology, which was a requirement for teaching in the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Santo_Tomas\" title=\"University of Santo Tomas\">University of Santo Tomas</a>. Fr. Paredes was a professor of political and administrative law at the UST Faculty of Civil Law which was then in <a href=\"/wiki/Intramuros\" title=\"Intramuros\">Intramuros</a>. He was also director of the UST published Catholic newspaper \"Libertas\".\n</p><p>In 1901, he returned to Spain where he assumed several positions of responsibility. He came back to Manila when in 1910, he was elected as the Prior Provincial of the Holy Rosary Province, a position he held for seven years. During his term as Provincial, he became among those responsible for the procurement of a land in Sulucan Hills on which the present UST Campus now stands. After his term ended, he went back to Spain to serve as the superior of a Dominican convent in Madrid. In 1926, despite his plea to be relieved of such great responsibility, Paredes was elected by the General Chapter as Master General of the Order. Due to some serious problems in the Order which weakened his health, Paredes resigned his office in 1929. He then retired to the convent in Oca\u00f1a.\n</p><p>When the civil war broke out in July 1936, Paredes was in Madrid. A month earlier, realizing that war was imminent, he expressed his desire to travel back to the Philippines. However, even after he was permitted by his superiors in Rome, Paredes could not leave Spain because the government would not issue him a passport. Providentially, Paredes had left his Madrid convent the night before it was attacked by armed men on July 19, 1936. After this event, Paredes, along with other Dominicans, had to be sheltered by a benefactor, Don Pedro Errazquin, himself murdered after a chalice belonging to Fr. Paredes was found in his house. Being constantly under police surveillance, Paredes had to stay in a boarding house, where he continued to perform his priestly duties: hearing confessions, praying the office, and celebrating the Eucharist. On August 11, he was arrested by armed men, and bravely he declared himself a priest and a religious. He was taken to a place of torture, and in the morning of the following day, he was shot in Valdesender\u00edn del Encinar. His rosary and his breviary was found near his cadaver.\n</p><p>In his honor, P.

In 1894, he entered the Dominican Order and after completing his theological studies, he was ordained to the priesthood on June 26, 1903.  He was then sent to the Philippines, and around the years 1905-1910, he taught at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He returned to Spain and was assigned to the Convent of Valencia. In 1916, he went back to the Philippines to teach in the University of Santo Tomas where he held a professorial chair in theology after obtaining his Doctorate in Sacred Theology from the UST Faculty of Sacred Theology in 1919. He became professor of dogmatic theology and canon law in the same faculty. He held several positions of responsibility in UST. He was Secretary General from 1919\u20131921 and Treasurer from 1929-1932. During the years 1921-1924, Villaverde was in the United States, serving as prior of the Dominican Community in Rosaryville, New Orleans. When he returned to Manila, he became the rector of the Colegio de San Juan de Letr\u00e1n from 1924-1927. He then became Dean of the UST Faculty of Sacred Theology from 1932-1934.  Among the new Thomasian blesseds, it was only Blessed Jes\u00fas Villaverde Andr\u00e9s who was able to see UST in its present location, having resided at the present Priory of St. Thomas Aquinas. For sure, Fr. Villaverde occupied one of the rooms in the UST Fathers' Residence.\n</p><p>Villaverde went back to Spain to serve as prior of the Santo Tom\u00e1s Convent in Avila and later on was assigned to Madrid. While in Madrid, his convent was attacked by the communists on July 1936. Fr. Villaverde had to hide in his mother's house in Cuesta de los Descargos. Later on, his brother, Carlos, a military man, took custody of him for three months. In his brother's house he did nothing but pray and console his family. On October 15, he was arrested by the milicianos. Carlos' children tried to save Fr. Villaverde by telling the arresting officers that there was no priest in their house, but when the milicianos threatened to take Carlos instead, Fr. Villaverde voluntarily showed up and handled himself over to the arresting officers. He was brought to the place of torture and later on executed; the manner of which still remains a mystery.\n</p><p>Throughout his life as a Dominican, Villaverde faithfully carried out all his duties as a priest and a religious. Often criticized for his being strict and somewhat temperamental, unknown to many, Villaverde was quietly suffering the pains brought on him by his liver disease. Witnesses of his priestly life affirm that he was an excellent preacher, and his brilliance as a theology earned him the respect of the Holy See.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Blessed_Pedro_Ib.C3.A1.C3.B1ez_Alonzo.2C_Manuel_Moreno_Martines.2C_Maximino_Fendandez_Mari.C3.B1as_and_Jos.C3.A9_Mar.C3.ADa_L.C3.B3pez_Carillo\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Blessed_Pedro_Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez_Alonzo,_Manuel_Moreno_Martines,_Maximino_Fendandez_Mari\u00f1as_and_Jos\u00e9_Mar\u00eda_L\u00f3pez_Carillo\">Blessed Pedro Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Alonzo, Manuel Moreno Martines, Maximino Fendandez Mari\u00f1as and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez Carillo</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Thomasian_Martyrs&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Blessed Pedro Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Alonzo, Manuel Moreno Martines, Maximino Fendandez Mari\u00f1as and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez Carillo\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>These four martyrs of the Religious Persecution in Spain sailed to the Philippines as young Dominican missionaries assigned to the Holy Rosary Province.

[1] All of them gave up their lives for their Christian faith, some in Japan , others in Vietnam , and in the 20th century, in Spain during the Spanish Civil War . St. Lorenzo Ruiz de Manila was among the lay companions of the Thomasian martyrs of Japan .

During this era, the country was ruled by the bakufu , a military government headed by the sh\u014dguns who governed the country in the name of the Emperor . The Emperor at this time had become a mere figurehead, secluded in his palace in Kyoto . Factors in the outbreak of severe repression of Christianity in Japan certainly included the fear of the Shoguns of all foreign influence. Contributory were the quarrels between Christian denominations, and imprudent acts of foreign navigators. Saint Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez [ edit ] Saint Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, OP Born c.1593 [3] Le\u00f3n , Spain Died 24 September 1637 Nagasaki , Japan Venerated\u00a0in Roman Catholic Church Beatified 18 February 1981 by Pope John Paul II Canonized 18 October 1987 by Pope John Paul II Feast 24 September Born in Le\u00f3n, Spain , Antonio Gonzalez entered the Dominican Order at the age of 16. His favorite saint was St. Peter of Verona , the protomartyr of the Dominican order, thus his religious enthusiasm gave rise to his living desire for martyrdom. After completing his studies, he was ordained and sent to Piedrahita as a theology professor. [3] When an invitation was sent to their convent asking for volunteer missionaries for the Far East, Gonz\u00e1lez was among those who eagerly volunteered. His target destination was Japan, but he had to prepare for this mission in the Philippines. He arrived in Manila in May 1632. He became professor and acting rector of the University of Santo Tomas . [3] In 1636, Gonz\u00e1lez was finally able to fulfill his dream of going to Japan. After a year of missionary activity, he was arrested, proudly wearing his habit to signify that he went to Japan for the sake of the Gospel. After suffering tremendous torture, he was found dead in his cell on the morning of 24 September 1637. Gonz\u00e1lez was canonized by Pope John Paul II in October 1987 together with his companion martyrs. Saint Domingo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Erquicia [ edit ] Main article: Domingo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Erquicia Born in February, 1589 in Regil , Guipuzcoa , Spain, Domingo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Erquicia entered the Dominican Priory of San Thelmo at the age of 16. Realizing the need for missionaries in the Far East, he joined the Dominicans who went to the Philippines and arrived in Manila in the year 1611 and became professor of Theology at the University of Santo Tom\u00e1s. Ten years later, he was sent to Japan. Constantly faced with danger, he spent his decade of mission in Japan faithfully preaching the Gospel and administering the sacraments, until he was finally caught by the Japanese authorities and killed through the \"gallows and hole\" torture. After thirty hours of continuous torture, he finally expired on August 14, 1633. Saint Lucas del Espiritu Santos [ edit ] Born in Zamora , Spain on October 18, 1594, he entered the Dominican Order at the age of 16. In the year 1617, he answered the missionary calling to evangelize in the Far East. He became Lecturer of Arts at the University of Santo Tom\u00e1s. Later on he was sent to Japan and arrived there in June 1623. For ten years, he engaged in underground apostolate. On September 8, 1633, he was arrested in Osaka , and a month later, on October 18, he was subjected to the \"gallows and hole\" torture. He died on the following day. Santo Tom\u00e1s Hioji de San Jacinto [ edit ] Born of Christian Japanese parents in 1590, in Ky\u016bsh\u016b , Japan, he witnessed how his parents were martyred for their Christian faith. He went to the Philippines and sought admission to the Dominican Order. He studied philosophy at the University of Santo Tom\u00e1s. He went back to Japan on November 10, 1629.  Being Japanese, Thomas was able to move about with some freedom. While doing his missionary endeavors, he chronicled the martyrdom of his fellow Dominicans. The Japanese authorities eventually arrested him. He was subjected to the \"gallows and hole\" torture and died on November 15, 1634. Saint Guillaume Courtet [ edit ] Main article: Guillaume Courtet Guillaume Courtet was a French Dominican of noble origins born in 1590. He joined the Order at the age of 17.

This was the largest mass beatification ever in the history of the Church. Religious persecution in Spain during the Spanish Civil War [ edit ] After the fall of the monarchy, the Second Spanish Republic was established. The Republican government and its supporters, a combined force of communists, socialists and anarchists, was particularly antagonistic towards the nobility, the land owners, and the Catholic Church. In 1936, a coup d'etat staged by rebel forces (Nacionalistas) attempted to overthrow the communist republicans, leading to a three-year political unrest characterized by extreme brutality and violence resulting to countless deaths among the government and rebel forces, as well as ordinary citizens caught in the war. Since the Catholic Church has been among those considered as enemies of the republicans, thousands of priests and religious perished in organized persecutions. Though the civil war began in 1936, communist forces had started torturing and executing priests and religious as early as 1933. Seventy-four Dominicans, most of them friars, were among those beatified last October 28 [ which? ] . Of these, eight stayed for some time in the Philippines, six of them, Thomasians. [4] Blessed Buenaventura Garc\u00eda Paredes [ edit ] Main article: Buenaventura Garc\u00eda de Paredes Fr. Buenaventura Paredes was the 78th successor of St. Dominic as Master of the Order of Preachers. Born to a pious family in Casta\u00f1edo de Valdes, Luarca, Spain on April 19, 1866, Buenaventura eventually decided to enter the Order of Preachers and received the Dominican habit on August 30, 1833. True to the Dominican tradition of scholarship, he studied Theology, Civil Law, and Philosophy and Letters prior to his ordination to the priesthood on July 25, 1891. After his ordination, he pursued further studies with which he earned his doctorate in Philosophy and Letters and in Jurisprudence. He then traveled to the Philippines as a missionary assigned to the Dominican Province of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary. While in Manila, he obtained the degree of lector in theology, which was a requirement for teaching in the University of Santo Tomas . Fr. Paredes was a professor of political and administrative law at the UST Faculty of Civil Law which was then in Intramuros . He was also director of the UST published Catholic newspaper \"Libertas\". In 1901, he returned to Spain where he assumed several positions of responsibility. He came back to Manila when in 1910, he was elected as the Prior Provincial of the Holy Rosary Province, a position he held for seven years. During his term as Provincial, he became among those responsible for the procurement of a land in Sulucan Hills on which the present UST Campus now stands. After his term ended, he went back to Spain to serve as the superior of a Dominican convent in Madrid. In 1926, despite his plea to be relieved of such great responsibility, Paredes was elected by the General Chapter as Master General of the Order. Due to some serious problems in the Order which weakened his health, Paredes resigned his office in 1929. He then retired to the convent in Oca\u00f1a. When the civil war broke out in July 1936, Paredes was in Madrid. A month earlier, realizing that war was imminent, he expressed his desire to travel back to the Philippines. However, even after he was permitted by his superiors in Rome, Paredes could not leave Spain because the government would not issue him a passport. Providentially, Paredes had left his Madrid convent the night before it was attacked by armed men on July 19, 1936. After this event, Paredes, along with other Dominicans, had to be sheltered by a benefactor, Don Pedro Errazquin, himself murdered after a chalice belonging to Fr. Paredes was found in his house. Being constantly under police surveillance, Paredes had to stay in a boarding house, where he continued to perform his priestly duties: hearing confessions, praying the office, and celebrating the Eucharist. On August 11, he was arrested by armed men, and bravely he declared himself a priest and a religious. He was taken to a place of torture, and in the morning of the following day, he was shot in Valdesender\u00edn del Encinar. His rosary and his breviary was found near his cadaver. In his honor, P. Paredes street, a street close to UST was named after him. Blessed Jesus Villaverde Andr\u00e9s [ edit ] Fr. Jesus Villaverde Andres was born in San Miguel de Due\u00f1as, Le\u00f3n, Spain , on December 4, 1877. In 1894, he entered the Dominican Order and after completing his theological studies, he was ordained to the priesthood on June 26, 1903.  He was then sent to the Philippines, and around the years 1905-1910, he taught at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He returned to Spain and was assigned to the Convent of Valencia. In 1916, he went back to the Philippines to teach in the University of Santo Tomas where he held a professorial chair in theology after obtaining his Doctorate in Sacred Theology from the UST Faculty of Sacred Theology in 1919. He became professor of dogmatic theology and canon law in the same faculty. He held several positions of responsibility in UST. He was Secretary General from 1919\u20131921 and Treasurer from 1929-1932. During the years 1921-1924, Villaverde was in the United States, serving as prior of the Dominican Community in Rosaryville, New Orleans. When he returned to Manila, he became the rector of the Colegio de San Juan de Letr\u00e1n from 1924-1927. He then became Dean of the UST Faculty of Sacred Theology from 1932-1934.  Among the new Thomasian blesseds, it was only Blessed Jes\u00fas Villaverde Andr\u00e9s who was able to see UST in its present location, having resided at the present Priory of St. Thomas Aquinas. For sure, Fr. Villaverde occupied one of the rooms in the UST Fathers' Residence. Villaverde went back to Spain to serve as prior of the Santo Tom\u00e1s Convent in Avila and later on was assigned to Madrid. While in Madrid, his convent was attacked by the communists on July 1936. Fr. Villaverde had to hide in his mother's house in Cuesta de los Descargos. Later on, his brother, Carlos, a military man, took custody of him for three months. In his brother's house he did nothing but pray and console his family. On October 15, he was arrested by the milicianos. Carlos' children tried to save Fr. Villaverde by telling the arresting officers that there was no priest in their house, but when the milicianos threatened to take Carlos instead, Fr. Villaverde voluntarily showed up and handled himself over to the arresting officers. He was brought to the place of torture and later on executed; the manner of which still remains a mystery. Throughout his life as a Dominican, Villaverde faithfully carried out all his duties as a priest and a religious. Often criticized for his being strict and somewhat temperamental, unknown to many, Villaverde was quietly suffering the pains brought on him by his liver disease. Witnesses of his priestly life affirm that he was an excellent preacher, and his brilliance as a theology earned him the respect of the Holy See. Blessed Pedro Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Alonzo, Manuel Moreno Martines, Maximino Fendandez Mari\u00f1as and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez Carillo [ edit ] These four martyrs of the Religious Persecution in Spain sailed to the Philippines as young Dominican missionaries assigned to the Holy Rosary Province. They stayed for sometime in the convent of Santo Domingo in Intramuros while taking up theological studies in the University of Santo Tom\u00e1s. They were ordained as priests in Santo Domingo Church, and after several assignments both in and out of the Philippines, they went back to Spain and were assigned to the Holy Rosary Convent in Madrid. After their convent was attacked by the Republicans, they went into hiding until they were found and arrested by the milicianos who tortured and eventually executed them. Fr. Alonzo was a missionary in China before going back to Spain He and Fr. Carillo tried to escape the persecution but the milicianos caught and executed them. Fr. Martines, who studied Moral Theology in UST, was executed after being caught by milicianos \ufffdin a train station. Eleven gunshot \ufffdwounds were found on the body \ufffdof Fr. Mari\u00f1as. Blessed Jose Maria de Manila [ edit ] Main article: Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda of Manila Born on September 5, 1880 in the old city of Manila, Eugenio Saz-Orozco took the name Jose Maria when he entered the Order of the Friars Minor Capuchin (OFMCap.) in Spain.
